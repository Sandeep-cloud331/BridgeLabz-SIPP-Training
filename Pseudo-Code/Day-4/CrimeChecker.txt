Graph zones
Each node = zone
Each edge = adjacency between zones
Each node has crimeScore

Function DFS(zone, visited, riskSum)
    Mark zone as visited
    riskSum = riskSum + zone.crimeScore
    For each neighbor in zone.neighbors
        If not visited[neighbor]
            DFS(neighbor, visited, riskSum)

Main
    For each zone in zones
        If not visited
            riskClusterScore = 0
            DFS(zone, visited, riskClusterScore)
            If riskClusterScore > threshold
                Print "High-risk cluster detected"
